# Time Expression DSL Documentation

## Overview

This domain-specific language (DSL) is designed to parse time expressions similar to natural language and convert them into a cron expression. The DSL supports a variety of time expressions, including specific dates, days of the week, months, and times of day. The goal of this DSL is to provide a simple and intuitive way to define time-based schedules for tasks or events.
